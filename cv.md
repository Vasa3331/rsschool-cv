## Code example:
N-th Fibonacci KATA from CODEWARS: I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.
I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n) returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.
For example:
```
   nthFibo(4) == 2
```
Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.
For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
My solution:
```
function nthFibo(n) {
  let arr = [0, 1, 1];
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    arr.push(arr[i] + arr[i + 1]);
  }
  return arr[n - 1];
}
```
